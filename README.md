CV FINAL


To run the file just open run_v3.py and click run. It will grab the 5 images in the current folder and classify them. The first image takes a while but then the other 4 are rather quick. It will place these images in the graded_imgs folder. You can see the results by checking the folder now. Delete the images and run the file if you want to see new images. As long as keras, numpy, scipy and other common libraries are implemented then the file should run without a problem.

Only the detection.py, processing.py, classification.py are ran. The custom_model.py & vgg_model.py are just showing the training files for those models.
